She deeply values the opportunity to work with children, adults and families from diverse backgrounds. Jacqueline's work is neuro-affirming and client-centered, incorporating the interests of her clients at the heart of her work. Her research interests include the application of AI in clinical practice; increasing access to ABA for disadvantaged populations; and improving supervision methods and outcomes. Jackie also serves as a board member for Black Applied Behavior Analysts (BABA). Outside of work and academics, she also enjoys hiking and exploring the outdoors, time with family, great food, coffee and creative writing.</p>

In the early part of his professional career, Asim dabbled in service coordination, research, interventions, and behavioral consultation for individuals with disabilities. Presently, Asim is stoked by the intersection of behavioral analysis and data science, OBM, choice-making, social media, tech, and ethics. Oh and birds, too! In a recent project, Asim explored the effects of an app fast on quality of life, delay discounting, and demand for apps. Outside of work, Asim enjoys scenic escapes to mountains or lakes, abandoning his phone, family time, spiritual activities, and a light dose of dad jokes (to qualify as a dad joke, it must be a-parent). His academic adventures continue to humble him to the following reality: there is always more to learn!</p>
