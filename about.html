Professionally, Joseph serves as Senior Director of Education and Professional Development, where he develops clinical standards, coordinates research efforts, and creates educational opportunities that have markedly enhanced professional development within the organization. Joseph's research interests center on nonlinear contingency analysis and the constructional approach to various clinical and organizational problems, as well as the dissemination of ABA. When he isn't nerding out about all things behavior analysis, he enjoys spending time with his family, reading books, and playing board games.</p>

                                    <p>Asim Javed, Ph.D., BCBA-D. In the early part of his professional career, Asim dabbled in service coordination, research, interventions, and behavioral consultation for individuals with disabilities. Presently, Asim is stoked by the intersection of behavioral analysis and data science, OBM, choice-making, social media, tech, and ethics. Oh and birds, too! In a recent project, Asim explored the effects of an app fast on quality of life, delay discounting, and demand for apps. Outside of work, Asim enjoys scenic escapes to mountains or lakes, abandoning his phone, family time, spiritual activities, and a light dose of dad jokes (to qualify as a dad joke, it must be a-parent). His academic adventures continue to humble him to the following reality: there is always more to learn!</p>
