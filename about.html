In the early part of his professional career, Asim dabbled in service coordination, research, interventions, and behavioral consultation for individuals with disabilities. Presently, Asim is stoked by the intersection of behavioral analysis and data science, OBM, choice-making, social media, tech, and ethics. Oh and birds, too! In a recent project, Asim explored the effects of an app fast on quality of life, delay discounting, and demand for apps. Outside of work, Asim enjoys scenic escapes to mountains or lakes, abandoning his phone, family time, spiritual activities, and a light dose of dad jokes (to qualify as a dad joke, it must be a-parent). His academic adventures continue to humble him to the following reality: there is always more to learn!</p>

                                    <h5>Jacob Sosine, M.A., M.B.A., BCBA</h5>
                                    <p>Jacob Sosine, M.A., M.B.A., BCBA. Jacob received his Bachelor’s degree in exercise physiology from Chico State University in 2010, his master’s in Professional Behavior Analysis from Florida Institute of Technology in 2015, and in 2020 he received a master’s in Business Administration from Saint Mary’s College of California. Jacob is primarily interested in the collection and ingestion of large datasets to further our understanding of human behavior and the field of behavior analysis. In addition, Jacob is passionate about developing and unlocking data pipelines to ask and answer novel research questions. Jacob’s current research projects involve leveraging a dataset of over 10,000 peer-reviewed publications to understand trends and gaps in published literature and analyzing the networks of citations that constitute peer-reviewed publications. Outside of scientific exploration, Jacob believes that the S.F. Giants will win the world series every year, and you can often catch him enjoying a game with his wife and young daughter.
